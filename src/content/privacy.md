We implement industry‑standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (e.g., HTTPS, encryption in transit, role‑based access, ISO‑27001‑certified hosting).  No system is 100 % secure; please use strong, unique passwords and enable multi‑factor authentication where offered.

---

### 9.  Data Retention

We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described, or as required by law (e.g., tax, accounting, product‑safety regulations).  Afterward, we de‑identify or securely delete the data.

### 13.  Location Data & Geofencing Services

If you enable location‑based features in a Rolitt device or app, we may collect coarse (IP‑based) or precise (GPS‑based) location data to trigger context‑aware behaviors (e.g., adjusting greetings by time zone).  Location data is processed on‑device where possible and is retained only as long as needed for that feature.

### 14. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability

Rolitt provides the Services and this Privacy Policy **“as is” and “as available.”**  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:

* **No Warranties.** We make no warranties or representations, express or implied, about the accuracy, completeness, security, or reliability of the Services or any content therein.
* **Events Beyond Our Control.** We are not responsible for any loss, corruption, disclosure, or unauthorized access to Personal Information that occurs due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control (including but not limited to natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, terrorism, labour disputes, Internet outages, or the actions of third‑party threat actors).
* **Third‑Party Activities.** We are not liable for the privacy, security, or data‑handling practices of any third‑party websites, apps, or services that are linked to or integrated with the Services, nor for any information you choose to share with those parties.
* **User Responsibilities.** You are solely responsible for safeguarding any credentials, devices, or network connections you use to access the Services.  We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep such information secure.
* **Limitation of Liability.** In no event will Rolitt, its directors, employees, agents, or affiliates be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages (including loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill) arising out of or related to this Privacy Policy or the processing of Personal Information, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.  Our **total cumulative liability** to you for all claims will not exceed (a) the amount you paid Rolitt for the Services in the **twelve (12) months** preceding the event giving rise to the liability or (b) **USD 100**, whichever is greater.
* **No Expansion of Obligations.** Nothing in this Privacy Policy creates any duty or liability on Rolitt beyond those required under applicable law.
